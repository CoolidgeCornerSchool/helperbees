## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Is the Helper Bees website done?  

We are in pilot mode.  We are asking a few parents to test out the site. The student volunteers are real. Anyone who lives near students of [Coolidge Corner School][] in Brookline, Massachusetts can request their help. We are testing to see if and how parents and kids will respond to Helper Bees!

#### How does it work?

8th grade student volunteers from [Coolidge Corner School][] in Brookline, Massachusetts list the jobs they will do. Neighbors seeking help choose a job offered by a student. They donate $10. Students and their parents will work with them to get the job done.

#### Where will my $10 donation go?

Your $10 donation will go toward the [Coolidge Corner School][] 8th grade PTO. The money raised will go toward 8th grade activities like the school play or a Thompson Island trip.

Students are volunteering their time.

#### What if I have a specific job in mind for a specific Helper Bee?
