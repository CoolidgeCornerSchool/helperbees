<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

## Is the Helper Bees website done? Is it ready? 

No, the Helper Bees website is still under construction. You can play around with it but it is not ready yet.

## Do I have to be in 8th grade to be a Helper Bee?

Yes, you must be an 8th grader at Coolidge Corner School to be a Helper Bee, but there are other ways younger students can help! For example, we need artists to create artwork for this website. Our logo was designed by a 5th grader using [Piskel][] (you can log in with your psbma.org account) who also created the bee below. Parents of artists should email ccs.helperbees@gmail.com to ask how their child can help.

## What if I have a specific job in mind for a specific Helper Bee?

If you have a specific job in mind, the following steps are recommended:

- Contact 8th graders (directly or through a parent) and tell to include your specific job under in the description when they sign up.
- Once the job is available, find it and click "Donate".
