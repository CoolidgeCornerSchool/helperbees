## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Is the Helper Bees website done?  

We are in pilot mode.  We are asking a few parents to test out the site. The student volunteers are real. Anyone can request their help. We are testing to see if and how parents and kids will respond to Helper Bees!

#### How does it work?

Students volunteers list the jobs they will do. People seeking help choose a job offered by a student. They donate $10. Students and their parents will work with them to get the job done.

#### Where will my $10 donation go?

Your $10 donation will go toward the Coolidge Corner 8th grade PTO. The money raised will go toward 8th grade activities like the school play or a Thompson Island trip.

Students are volunteering their time.

#### What if I have a specific job in mind for a specific Helper Bee?

If you have a specific job in mind, the following steps are recommended:

- Contact 8th graders (directly or through a parent) and tell them to include your specific job under in the description when they sign up.
- Once the job is available, find it and click "Donate".

#### Do I have to be in 8th grade to be a Helper Bee?

Yes, you must be an 8th grader at Coolidge Corner School to be a
Helper Bee, but there are other ways younger students can help! For
example, we need artists to create artwork for this website. Our logo
was designed by a 5th grader using [Piskel][] (you can log in with
your psbma.org account) who also created the bee below. Parents of
artists should email
[ccs.helperbees@gmail.com](mailto:ccs.helperbees@gmail.com)
to ask how their child can help.
