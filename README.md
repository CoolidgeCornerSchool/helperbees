# Helper Bees

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

Matching student volunteers to neighborhood donors.

## Introduction

8th grade students at [Coolidge Corner School][] in Brookline, Massachusetts are volunteering their time to offer services such as dog walking or snow shoveling to raise money for student activities throughout the year through donations by people in their neighborhood.

## Mission

Helper Bees is an experiment run by the parents of the Coolidge Corner School in Brookline, Massachusetts. Our mission is to give students an opportunity to volunteer, build a strong community, and raise money for student activities.

Parents and students must raise money each year to fund everything from the school play to class events. As parents we challenged ourselves to imagine a way to do this in a way that involves the whole community.

Helper Bees was "soft launched" on November 20, 2019. If you have been contacted about Helper Bees, please try out the site and email [ccs.helperbees@gmail.com](mailto:ccs.helperbees@gmail.com) with any feedback!
